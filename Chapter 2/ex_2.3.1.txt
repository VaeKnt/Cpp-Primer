Exercise 2.15:
a) int ival = 1.01; valid
b) int &rval = 1.01; invalid: references must be defined with the initializer as an object, not a literal
c) int &rval2 = ival; valid
d) int &rval3; invalid: references must be initialized

Exercise 2.16:
a) r2 = 3.14159; valid, assigns object to which r2 refers to (d) new value of 3.14159. 
b) r2 = r1; valid, assigns value to r2 which r1 refers to: i  
c) i = r2; valid, assigns to i the value to which object r2 refers to.
d) r1 = d; valid, assigns to object to which r1 refers to (i) the value of d 

Exercise 2.17:

int i, &ri = i;
i = 5; ri = 10;
std::cout << i << " " << ri << std::endl

OUTPUT: 10 10
