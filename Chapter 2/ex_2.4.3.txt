Exercise 2.30:
const int v2 = 0; int v1 = v2;
int *p1 = &v1, &r1 = v1;
const int *p2 = &v2, *const p3 = &i, &r2 = v2;

v2: top level const
v1: 
p1: low-level const
r1: 
p2: low level const
p3: top and low level const
r2: low-level const

Exercise 2.31:
r1 = v2; Legal 
p1 = p2; Illegal, p2 has low-level const but p1 doesn't.
p2 = p1; Legal, int * can be converted to const *int
p1 = p3; Illegal, p1 doesn't have have low level const
p2 = p3; Legal, same low-level const.
