Exercise 3.12:

a) vector<vector<int>> ivec; Legal, ivec is a vector whose elements are vectors that hold ints
b) vector<string> svec = ivec; Illegal, ivec elements and svec elements are not of the same type
c) vector<string> svec(10,"null"); Legal, svec is then a vector of size ten where each element is the string "null"
